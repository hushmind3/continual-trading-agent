This repository is the official GitHub implementation of the paper “Re(visiting) Time Series Foundation Models in Finance” by Eghbal Rahimikia, Hao Ni
and Weiguan Wang. It provides minimal, reproducible workflows for loading and runing Amazon Chronos 1.x and Google TimesFM checkpoints that are published on Hugging Face. The repo favors short, explicit instructions so users can copy the environment, download weights, and run the demos immediately.

## Quickstart (uv)
With the following steps, user shall be able to build an envrionment that allows to load both Chronos 1.x and TimesFM 1.x models.
1. Create virtual environment with `uv venv --python 3.11 .venv`
2. Activate the environment (`.venv\\Scripts\\activate` on PowerShell, `source .venv/bin/activate` on bash).
3. `uv pip sync requirements.txt`
4. Run `python scripts/validate_env.py` to confirm the Chronos and TimesFM checkpoints load correctly. 
5. Open `notebooks/predict-with-chronos1.ipynb` or `predict-with-timesfm1` (in VS Code with jupyter plugin or use "jupyter notebook" in command line tool) to load data and generate forecasts using the corresponding models.


## Repository layout
```
├── data/
│   └── two_stocks_excess_returns.csv
├── notebooks/
│   └── predict-with-x.ipynb
├── pyproject.toml
├── requirements.txt
└── scripts/
    └── validate_env.py
├── tsfm_finance    # utility module to load TSFM
```

`two_stocks_excess_returns.csv` is a tiny daily-frequency example that contains daily excess returns for Microsoft and Apple stocks.


## Primary entry point
- `python scripts/validate_env.py`: light-weight smoke test that loads Chronos (`amazon/chronos-t5-mini`) and TimesFM (`google/timesfm-1.0-200m-pytorch`) using the baked-in defaults. Edit the script if you want to change checkpoints.
- `notebooks/predict-with-x.ipynb`: interactive workflow that reads `data/two_stocks_excess_returns.csv`, keeps the final `prediction_length` rows as ground truth, and produces Chronos/TimesFM forecasts for comparison or plotting. Update the notebook cells (for example, the TimesFM loader arguments) to experiment with different checkpoints or datasets, then rerun the cells.

## Hugging Face checkpoints
- Chronos defaults to `amazon/chronos-t5-mini` to keep downloads small. Edit the validation script or notebook to load another Chronos 1.x release (e.g., `amazon/chronos-t5-small`).
- TimesFM defaults to `google/timesfm-1.0-200m-pytorch`. Modify the validation script or tweak the notebook's loader call to try another repo slug.

All tooling respects `HF_HOME` for caching and reads `HF_TOKEN` (if set) for gated models.

## Import the models
`notebooks/predict-with-chronos1.ipynb` and `notebooks/predict-with-timesfm1.ipynb` contain end-to-end walkthroughs. The snippet below shows the core imports so you can script Chronos/TimesFM forecasts without opening a notebook.

```python
import torch
import pandas as pd
from chronos import ChronosPipeline
from tsfm_finance.timesfm_loader import load_timesfm

df_excess_ret = pd.read_csv("data/two_stocks_excess_returns.csv", index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
window_size = 21
input_tensor = torch.tensor(df_excess_ret.iloc[:window_size].values.T)

chronos = ChronosPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "FinText/Chronos_Small_2022_Global",
    device_map="auto",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)
chronos_forecast = chronos.predict(input_tensor, prediction_length=1, num_samples=20)

timesfm = load_timesfm(
    source="FinText/TimesFM_8M_2023_Augmented",
    model_size="8M",
    prediction_length=1,
)
point_forecast, quantile_forecast = timesfm.forecast(input_tensor)

# Want the “vanilla” checkpoints from Hugging Face for zero-shot instead of the FinText ones?
# Reuse the exact defaults from scripts/validate_env.py:
chronos_default = ChronosPipeline.from_pretrained("amazon/chronos-t5-mini", device_map="auto")

from timesfm import TimesFm, TimesFmCheckpoint, TimesFmHparams

timesfm_hparams = TimesFmHparams(
    backend="cpu",
    context_len=128,
    horizon_len=128,
    input_patch_len=32,
    output_patch_len=128,
)
timesfm_default = TimesFm(
    hparams=timesfm_hparams,
    checkpoint=TimesFmCheckpoint(version="torch", huggingface_repo_id="google/timesfm-1.0-200m-pytorch"),
)

```

`load_timesfm` accepts either a Hugging Face repo slug (as shown above) or a local directory/file containing `model.safetensors`.

## Additional models
Additional TSFMs that are not hosted on Hugging Face are available from [fintext.ai](https://fintext.ai/?page_id=331). We currently provide two bundles: models trained on synthetic data and models trained with adjusted hyperparameters. Follow these steps to download, unpack, and load the checkpoints:

1. **Download.** Open [the FinText download page](https://fintext.ai/?page_id=331) and choose **Download (Synthetic)** or **Download (HParam)** on the left navigation bar. Pick the category and year you need; the site returns a `.rar` archive.
2. **Extract.** Use your preferred tool (`tar -xf 2022.rar`, WinRAR, 7-Zip, etc.) to decompress the archive.
3. **Move into this repo.** Place the extracted folder in the repository root (the directory that already contains `README.md`). With the default names, the structure should resemble:
   ```
   TSFM_Finance/
   |-- README.md
   |-- FinText_extra_models/
   |   |-- Chronos_Small_2022_Synthetic/
   |   |   |-- config.json
   |   |   `-- model.safetensors
   |   `-- TimesFM_20M_2022_Synthetic/
   |       `-- model.safetensors
   `-- ...
   ```
4. **Load the checkpoints.** Point the sample code at the extracted paths. For example, if [Chronos-Tiny-2022](https://fintext.ai/TSFMs/Synthetic/Chronos%20(Tiny)%20-%20Synthetic/2022.rar) is unpacked into `FinText_extra_models/Chronos_Tiny_2022_Synthetic`, run:
   ```python
   chronos = ChronosPipeline.from_pretrained(
       "FinText_extra_models/Chronos_Tiny_2022_Synthetic",
       device_map="auto",
       dtype=torch.bfloat16,
   )
   ```
   Similarly, a TimesFM download such as [TimesFM-20M-2022](https://fintext.ai/TSFMs/Synthetic/TimesFM%20(20M)%20-%20Synthetic/2022.rar), extracted to `FinText_extra_models/TimesFM_20M_2022_Synthetic`, can be loaded with:
   ```python
    from tsfm_finance.timesfm_loader import load_timesfm_from_local
    timesfm = load_timesfm_from_local(
        path="FinText_extra_models/TimesFM_20M_2022_Synthetic",
        model_size="20M",
        prediction_length=1,
    )
   ```
   Replace the folder names in the strings above with the directories that correspond to the bundle you downloaded.
