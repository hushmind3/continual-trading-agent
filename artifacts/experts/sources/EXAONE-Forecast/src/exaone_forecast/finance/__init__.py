"""EXAONE Finance — the financial domain model of the EXAONE Forecast family.

    from exaone_forecast.finance import from_pretrained

    fc = from_pretrained(device="cuda:0")
    q  = fc.predict(my_series, horizon=20)

The encoder is attention-free: temporal mixing is a 1D causal convolution and
variate mixing is a group-aware pooling MLP, so cost grows linearly in both
sequence length and variate count. This design is particular to this model and
is not shared family-wide.

The weights are published separately at ``LG-AI-Research/EXAONE-Finance-1.0`` on the
Hugging Face Hub and are covered by the EXAONE AI Model License Agreement
1.2 - NC (non-commercial). Installing this package does not grant commercial
rights to the weights it downloads.
