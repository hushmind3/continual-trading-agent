"""Shared helper for loading a released checkpoint into its model class.

Every model in the family publishes a checkpoint directory holding ``config.json``
and ``model.safetensors``. The weights are loaded by building the model from its
config and then calling ``load_state_dict`` on the raw tensors — that is,
**bypassing** ``PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained``'s weight-conversion path.

This is deliberate. A model whose config declares a ``model_type`` that
transformers recognises, and whose layers reuse that architecture's parameter
names, will have its weights rewritten by the conversion transformers >= 5
applies on ``from_pretrained`` — silently, and to something the checkpoint never
meant. A plain ``load_state_dict`` is verbatim and transformers-version
independent.
