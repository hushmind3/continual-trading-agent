**EXAONE Finance** is a **time series foundation model for financial forecasting**. It uses an
**attention-free** architecture: self-attention is replaced by two linear-time operators — a
**causal 1D convolution** for temporal mixing and a **group-aware pooling MLP** for variate mixing —
so cost grows **linearly** in both sequence length and variate count. A **masked-context
augmentation** exposes the model to contiguous missing spans during training, making it robust to
the missingness pervasive in financial markets.

It is pretrained on a **synthetic financial corpus** whose generator is designed to reproduce the
properties of financial series: heavy tails, volatility clustering, jumps, regime shifts, and
cross-asset dependence.

Forecasting is **zero-shot and probabilistic** — each series is forecast from its own recent
history, with no per-dataset training.

## Architecture

<div style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.1); border-radius: 12px; padding: 12px 24px;">

- Encoder: attention-free — temporal mixing → variate mixing → feed-forward, each residual
- Temporal mixing: stacked causal 1D convolutions, left-padded (no future leakage)
- Variate mixing: group-aware mean pooling followed by an MLP
- Input pipeline: instance normalization (optional arcsinh) → patching → residual-MLP embedding
- Head: patch decoder emitting multi-quantile trajectories
- Training augmentation: masked-context — a contiguous input span is marked known-missing

## Evaluation Results

Zero-shot results on **FinVerse**, a financial forecasting benchmark spanning FX, commodities,
crypto-assets, fixed income, equities, ETFs, and macroeconomic indicators. **44 models** were scored
on identical windows. Models are ranked per (tier, spec, metric) cell; *Avg. Rank* is the geometric
mean of per-cell ranks, and **Rank Sum** is the sum of the three per-tier placements — lower is
better.

| # | Model | Tier 1 (Point) | Avg. Rank | Tier 2 (IC) | Avg. Rank | Tier 3 (Portfolio) | Avg. Rank | Rank Sum |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **EXAONE Finance** | **1** | **6.53** | **1** | **7.45** | **1** | **7.43** | **3** |
| 2 | Chronos-2 (Synthetic) | 9 | 11.68 | 3 | 8.74 | 2 | 9.90 | 14 |
| 3 | Reverso (Small) | 6 | 9.60 | 2 | 8.64 | 6 | 13.04 | 14 |
| 4 | TiRex-1.1 | 2 | 6.98 | 4 | 9.71 | 14 | 15.76 | 20 |
| 5 | Chronos-2 | 8 | 10.14 | 13 | 16.12 | 9 | 15.17 | 30 |

The three tiers score complementary objectives:

- **Tier 1 — Point accuracy.** MASE against an in-context naïve forecast, plus directional hit rate.
- **Tier 2 — Cross-sectional skill.** Information coefficient: the Spearman rank correlation between
  predicted and realized changes across assets at each origin.
- **Tier 3 — Portfolio backtest.** Annualized return, Sharpe ratio, volatility, and maximum drawdown
  of a top-*K*% equal-weight long-only portfolio.

EXAONE Finance ranks **first in all three tiers** for a perfect rank sum of **3**, ahead of the
strongest baseline at 14.

  <em>Figure 1. Average rank within each tier (lower is better). EXAONE Finance leads all three,
  and no baseline is consistently strong across them.</em>
</div>

At **202M parameters** it sits on the Pareto frontier, outperforming models more than an order of
magnitude larger — the scaling law familiar from general-domain forecasting does not yet hold here.

It is also the **only model that wins its head-to-head comparison against all 43 baselines**, with
per-opponent win rates from 0.51 to 0.90.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install "exaone-forecast[finance] @ git+https://github.com/LGAI-Research/EXAONE-Forecast.git"
```

```python
import numpy as np
from exaone_forecast.finance import from_pretrained

fc = from_pretrained(device="cuda:0")          # downloads the weights on first use

series = [np.random.randn(500).cumsum() + 100 for _ in range(4)]

q = fc.predict(series, horizon=20)             # (4, 21, 20)  all quantile levels
yhat = fc.point(series, horizon=20)            # (4, 20)      median forecast
lo, hi = fc.interval(series, horizon=20, lower=0.1, upper=0.9)
```

A runnable end-to-end example is in [`quickstart.py`](./quickstart.py).

## Available checkpoints

| File | Version | Parameters | Dtype | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exaone-finance-1.0.safetensors` | 1.0 | 202M | float32 | 21-quantile head; loaded by `from_pretrained("default")` |

The file lives in the [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/LG-AI-Research/EXAONE-Finance-1.0)
alongside its `config.json`, which describes the architecture. `from_pretrained` fetches both and
loads the weights verbatim.

## Intended use

EXAONE Finance is intended for **zero-shot probabilistic forecasting** of financial and other
real-valued time series, for **research and educational** purposes. Each series is forecast from its
own recent history; no per-dataset training is required. Use of the released weights is limited to
non-commercial research and education by the EXAONE model license.

**Not intended for:** any **commercial** use of the released weights, or any use excluded by the
[license](#license). Forecasts are statistical outputs, **not financial advice** — do not use them
as the sole basis for an investment decision.

<br>

## Limitation

**Domain coverage.** Results are reported on a financial benchmark. Broad general-domain
benchmarking is future work, and behaviour outside the tested asset classes is not characterised.

**Zero-shot only.** Only zero-shot performance is reported. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning and
ensembling are promising but untested directions.

**Variate grouping.** In this release every series is treated as an individual channel. The
group-aware mixer natively supports richer cross-series grouping — from the multiple fields of a
single security to related instruments within a portfolio — but that capability is not exercised by
the published checkpoint. Systematically exploring these grouping schemes, and scaling to broader
multivariate financial panels, is a promising direction for further gains.
